#WEEK 1
* This first week I was introduced to a new course of Discrete Mathematics.
* I learned that this course is different from any other math subjects because this talks about logic and proof.
* After the questions about the Knights and Knaves, I realized that in this course, I should be able to think critically and logically.
* I learned new concepts like Propositions, how to distinguish whther a given statement is a proposition, Truth Table, how helpful this table is, and Logical Connectives such as ¬ Negation, ∧ Conjunction,∨ Disjunction, ⊕ Exclusive or, → Conditional, ↔ Biconditional

#WEEK 2
* We were introduced on proving using Logical Equivalences.
* This topic got me confused becuase of the different laws involved in it.
* It took me quite some time to be able to fully understand that topic.But still I'm not so confident about those Logical Equivlences.
* I also learned about Existential Quantifiers which is onlky true for some values and Universal Quantifiers which is always true for any possible values.
* This week, we were also taught about the Rules of Inference.
* This topic is also quite difficult for me just like the Logical Equivalences because I must be familiar with every rule and when it must be used in proving.

#WEEK 3
* This week, we were introduce to a new topic which is the different Methods of proofs.
* I was able to easily understand Direct Proof and Proof by Contraposition becuase it seems to be just like proving using mathematical ways.
* I think the easiest among the methods so far is the Vacuous and Trivial Proofs. Because in Vacuous Proof, we just need to show that p is false so that the given statement is already proven and in Trivial Proof, q must be proven to be true so that the statement will be proven true.

#WEEK 4
* This week, we learned about Mathematical Induction.
* Mathematical Induction includes two steps: 
  * 1.) Basis Step 
  * 2.) Direct Proof.
* We were also introduced to Summation.
* This one's quite confusing becausew we were given an example where we need to look for an equation. I'm not really good iin coming up with an equation for a certain example that's why I find this topic quite challenging.
* Still, we need to prove that the equation we come up with is true using Mathematical Induction.
* Then we were introduced with Recursive/Inductice Definition.
* The first step is Basis step where we specify the value of the function at zero. And the  next step would be find an equation for finding the value of the integer.
* Lastly, we were inrtoduced to Recursive Definition --an algorithm is recursive  if it solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.

#WEEK 5
* This week, we discussed the last method of proof which is the Proof by Equivalence.
* This proof is quite easy beacuse it is just proving that a biconditional is true using the other methods of proof.
* now, we had Mathematical Induction.
* We were also introduced to Recursive and Inductive Definition.
* Recursive Algorithm and Program correctness were also introduced to us.

#WEEK 6
* We continued the discussion about program correctness where we need to prove that the program always gives the correct output.
* There are two step two verify a program:
  * 1.) show that the correct answer is obtained if the program teminates (prgram correctness) and 
  * 2.) show that the program always terminates.
* I also learned about Initial Assertion which hives the properties the the input must have, and the Final Assertion which the output must have.
* I also learned about the Hoare Triple: *p{S}q*.
* The use of the Rules of Inference with Program Correctness was also taught.
* I also learned about Zeno's Paradox and the Power Series.
* I discovered about the Set Theory and what a Power Set is and what Cardinality means.
* Then we also discussed the Set Theory.
* I learned that in a Set, the order and the quantity is not important in knowing if two sets is the same as long as they have the same elements in it.
* We also reviewed the Venn Diagram, which also includes the Set Operations:
  * Union
  * Intersection
  * Set Difference
  * Symetric Difference
* I also learned that if all elements of Set A are also elements of B, then set a is a subset of B.
* Power Set were also introduced to our class.
* Cardinality was also discussed which is the number of elements it contains if A is a set and we denot it by *{A}*.

#WEEK 7
* This week, we started dicsussing about Functions and that it is sometimes called mappings or transformations.
* I also learned how to determine the domian and codomain of a function.
* Different types of Functions:
  * One-To-One Function
    * If and only if *f(a)=f(b)* implies that *a=b* for all *a* and *b* in the domain of *f*.
  * Onto Function
    * If the range and domain are equal and that every member of the codomain is the image of some elementof the domain.
  * Bijection
    * If it is both *one-to-one* and *onto*.
    * Also called *one-to-one correspondence*.
