WEEK 1
This first week I was introduced to a new course of Discrete Mathematics.
I learned that this course is different from any other math subjects because this talks about logic and proof.
After the questions about the Knights and Knaves, I realized that in this course, I should be able to think critically and logically.
I learned new concepts like Propositions, how to distinguish whther a given statement is a proposition, Truth Table, how helpful this table is, and Logical Connectives such as ¬ Negation, ∧ Conjunction,∨  Disjunction,  ⊕ Exclusive or,  → Conditional,  ↔ Biconditional
